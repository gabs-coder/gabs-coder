- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabs-coder
- 👀 I’m interested in creating methods to pass information through web applications

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that contributes in giving information to those that can't get it easily, through the new web apps
- 📫 How to reach me: 
 Send me an e-mail to gabo2023brazil@gmail.com, and I would be glad to receive and read it!
